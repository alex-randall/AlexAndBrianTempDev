# Core.RedirectBanner #

### Summary ###
RedirectBanner is a SharePoint customization (compatible with Office 365/SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2016, SharePoint 2013, and SharePoint 2010) 
that places a developer configurable red message at the top of every page of a specific site collection/root site/sub site telling the end user that 
the site has moved and they need to upgrade their favorites/bookmarks with the new url (which they can click on to go to the new site).  
It also auto redirects after 30 seconds if the user doesnâ€™t do anything.

It can be deployed/configured/overridden at both:
- a site collection level
- a root site/sub site/web level
