# Core.RedirectBanner #

### Summary ###
Core.RedirectBanner is a SharePoint customization 
that places a developer configurable red message at the top of every page of a specific site collection/root site/sub site telling the end user that 
the site has moved and they need to upgrade their favorites/bookmarks with the new url (which they can click on to go to the new site).  
This is useful for the following scenarios:
- SharePoint upgrades/migrations
- SharePoint site moves/renames

Additional features:
- auto redirects to the new url after 30 seconds (configurable) if the user doesnâ€™t do anything.
- can be deployed at both:
  - site collection level (deployed to all current sub sites including root site)
  - individual root site/sub site/web level
- can override urls at sub site level if needed
